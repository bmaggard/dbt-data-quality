# dbt-data-quality
Data quality checks in your dbt flow.

This repository helps you understand the different data quality checks available in [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).

You can clone the repository, create a `supabase` account, write the `.env` file and run the commands according to the environment setup, and get an environment where you can practice testing with dbt **for free**.

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<postgres_password>
POSTGRES_DATABASE=<postgres_database>
```

Commands to setup the environment:
